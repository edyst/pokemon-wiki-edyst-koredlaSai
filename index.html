                Nintendo and
                The Pokémon
                Company under the Pokemon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,

                released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue and the main series of role-playing video games

                    Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the
                    three
                    starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                    Water
                    is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other
                    sea-dwelling creatures.</p>

                <p>
                    Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the
                    three
                    starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                    Fire
                    types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter
                    is
                    often a plus.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Grass is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Water, which constitute
                    the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
                    players. Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types
                    that
                    are resistant to Grass moves.

                <p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting
                    out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
                    themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July
                    and December.</p>
                <p>Pokémon GO is one of the most successful mobile games of all time, breaking records like fastest to
                    earn $100 million and most-downloaded in its first month of release. To date, it has grossed almost
                    $2 billion in revenue and been downloaded 800 million times. Although no longer the global
                    phenomenon it was in 2016, the game remains incredibly popular.</p>

                                    versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even
                                    stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe
                                    you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all
